If the game crashes at startup, contact me on Discord @punctualex.

Split Screen:
- Supports 3 or 4 players in Halo 1, Halo 3, Halo 3: ODST, Halo: Reach, and Halo 4.
- Not supported for Co-Op in Halo 2. Attempting to do so will cause the game to get stuck at loading.
- For 3 or 4 players in Co-Op in Halo 1 and Halo 4, you can only start the game with a maximum of 2 players.
- In Halo 1, you need to add other players while loading the map on the counter in the Halo 1 Page, or if the map is loaded, restart the mission.
- In Halo 4, you need to add them while loading the map or in the game on the counter in the Alpha Ring Page.
